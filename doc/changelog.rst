Motor 0.2
---------

Changes
~~~~~~~

Motor 0.2 now requires Tornado 3. However, the previous version, Motor 0.1, is
still available for Tornado 2 users.

Motor 0.2 drops Python 2.5 support (since Tornado 3 has dropped it).

Motor 0.2 requires PyMongo 2.7, whereas Motor 0.1 required PyMongo 2.5.0
exactly.

It is no longer necessary to explicitly "open" a MotorClient or
MotorReplicaSetClient. The ``open_sync`` method is removed and calling
``open`` is now optional. Motor clients now connect to MongoDB on demand.

Similarly, :meth:`MotorGridOut.open` is optional. :class:`MotorGridIn`
and :class:`MotorGridFS` now have no ``open`` method at all.

All Motor asynchronous methods (except
:meth:`MotorCursor.each`) now return a :class:`~tornado.concurrent.Future`.
The callback argument
to these methods is now optional. If a callback is passed, it will be
executed with the (result, error) of the operation as in Motor 0.1. If no
callback is passed, a Future is returned that resolves to the method's
result or error.

The ``length`` argument to :meth:`MotorCursor.to_list` is no longer optional:
it's dangerous to let Motor buffer unlimited data from a single query.
You can pass ``None`` as the length if you still want to retrieve the whole
result set as a single list, no matter how large.

:class:`MotorPool` has been rewritten, both to support the same new features
as the new PyMongo 2.6 Pool, and to stop subclassing PyMongo's Pool to protect
Motor somewhat from PyMongo changes.

:class:`MotorClient` and :class:`MotorReplicaSetClient` no longer support the
``max_concurrent`` option; ``max_pool_size`` has taken on the function of
``max_concurrent`` and the default ``max_pool_size`` is bumped from 10 to 100.
``max_wait_time`` is replaced by ``waitQueueTimeoutMS`` and
``waitQueueMultiple``. Timeouts raise a PyMongo :exc:`ConnectionFailure`;
:exc:`MotorPoolTimeout` is gone.

Motor can take advantage of Tornado 3's `asynchronous resolver interface`_. By
default, Motor still uses blocking DNS, but you can do configure non-blocking
lookup with a threaded resolver::

    Resolver.configure('tornado.netutil.ThreadedResolver')

Or install `pycares`_ and use the c-ares resolver:

    Resolver.configure('tornado.platform.caresresolver.CaresResolver')

The ``MotorCursor.tail`` method has been removed. It was complex, diverged from
PyMongo's feature set, and encouraged overuse of MongoDB capped collections as
message queues when a purpose-built message queue is more appropriate. An
example of tailing a capped collection is provided instead:
:doc:`examples/tailable-cursors`.

``MotorClient.is_locked`` has been removed since calling it from Motor would be
bizarre. See "Migration" below for a workaround.

The yield-point classes ``WaitOp`` and ``WaitAllOps`` have been removed, since
Tornado 3's ``Future`` interface has equivalent functionality.

:meth:`~web.GridFSHandler.get_gridfs_file` now
returns a Future instead of accepting a callback.

Migration
~~~~~~~~~

``open``, ``open_sync``
'''''''''''''''''''''''

``open`` is now optional, and ``open_sync`` has been removed. You can remove
calls to these methods from your application. The one remaining use for these
calls is to test if the MongoDB server is available before continuing your
application's startup. This is still possible with ``IOLoop.run_sync``::

    loop = tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current()
    client = motor.MotorClient(host, port)
    try:
        loop.run_sync(client.open)
    except pymongo.errors.AutoReconnect:
        print "Can't connect"

Futures
'''''''

``motor.Op`` is deprecated. You can continue to use it, but the simpler
syntax yielding a Future is preferred::

    document = yield collection.find_one()

Code that uses explicit callbacks with Motor 0.2 works the same as in Motor
0.1::

    def callback(document, error):
        if error:
            logging.error("Oh no!")
        else:
            print document

    collection.find_one(callback=callback)

``WaitOp`` and ``WaitAllOps``
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

``WaitOp`` and ``WaitAllOps`` have been removed. Code that used them can now
yield a ``Future`` or a list of them. Consider this function written for
Tornado 2 and Motor 0.1::

    @gen.engine
    def get_some_documents():
        cursor = collection.find().sort('_id').limit(2)
        cursor.to_list(callback=(yield gen.Callback('key')))
        do_something_while_we_wait()
        try:
            documents = yield motor.WaitOp('key')
            print documents
        except Exception, e:
            print e

The function now becomes::

    @gen.coroutine
    def f():
        cursor = collection.find().sort('_id').limit(2)
        future = cursor.to_list(2)
        do_something_while_we_wait()
        try:
            documents = yield future
            print documents
        except Exception, e:
            print e

Similarly, a function written like so for Tornado 2 and Motor 0.1::

    @gen.engine
    def get_two_documents_in_parallel(collection):
        collection.find_one(
            {'_id': 1}, callback=(yield gen.Callback('one')))

        collection.find_one(
            {'_id': 2}, callback=(yield gen.Callback('two')))

        try:
            doc_one, doc_two = yield motor.WaitAllOps(['one', 'two'])
            print doc_one, doc_two
        except Exception, e:
            print e

Now it becomes::

    @gen.coroutine
    def get_two_documents_in_parallel(collection):
        future_0 = collection.find_one({'_id': 1})
        future_1 = collection.find_one({'_id': 2})

        try:
            doc_one, doc_two = yield [future_0, future_1]
            print doc_one, doc_two
        except Exception, e:
            print e

Pool options
''''''''''''

PyMongo 2.6 updated its connection pooling options. Motor's options
have changed for increased consistency with PyMongo.

:class:`MotorClient` and :class:`MotorReplicaSetClient` have an option
``max_pool_size``, which meant "minimum idle sockets to keep open", but its
meaning has changed to "maximum sockets open per host." Once this limit is
reached, operations will pause waiting for a socket to become available.
Therefore the default has been raised from 10 to 100. If you pass a value for
``max_pool_size`` make sure it's large enough for the expected load. (Sockets
are only opened when needed, so there's no cost to having a ``max_pool_size``
larger than necessary. Err towards a larger value.) If you've been accepting
the default, continue to do so.

The ``max_concurrent`` option is removed, since ``max_pool_size`` now fulfills
the same purpose. If you passed this option, you can remove it or rename to
``max_pool_size``.

``max_wait_time`` has been renamed ``waitQueueTimeoutMS`` for consistency with
PyMongo. If you pass ``max_wait_time``, rename it and multiply by 1000.

The :exc:`MotorPoolTimeout` exception is gone; catch PyMongo's
:exc:`ConnectionFailure` instead.

to_list
'''''''

Any calls to :meth:`MotorCursor.to_list` that omitted the ``length``
argument must now include it::

    result = yield collection.find().to_list(100)

``None`` is acceptable, meaning "unlimited." Use with caution.

tail
''''

If you relied on ``MotorCursor.tail``, see :doc:`examples/tailable-cursors`
for an example of tailing a capped collection with Motor using a coroutine.

is_locked
'''''''''

If you called ``MotorClient.is_locked`` like::

    locked = yield motor.Op(client.is_locked)

you should now do::

    result = yield client.admin.current_op()
    locked = bool(result.get('fsyncLock', None))

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

``MotorReplicaSetClient.open`` threw an error if called without a callback.

``MotorCursor.to_list`` `ignored SON manipulators
<https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MOTOR-8>`_. (Thanks to Eren GÃ¼ven for the
report and the fix.)

Motor 0.1.2
-----------

Fixes innocuous unittest failures when running against Tornado 3.1.1.

Motor 0.1.1
-----------

Fixes issue `MOTOR-12`_ by pinning its PyMongo dependency to PyMongo version
2.5.0 exactly.

Motor relies on some of PyMongo's internal details, so changes to PyMongo can
break Motor, and a change in PyMongo 2.5.1 did. Eventually PyMongo will expose
stable hooks for Motor to use, but for now I changed Motor's dependency from
``PyMongo>=2.4.2`` to ``PyMongo==2.5.0``.
